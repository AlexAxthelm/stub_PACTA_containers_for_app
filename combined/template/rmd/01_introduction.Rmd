The following table provides an overview of key components and principles underlying the PACTA methodology.

|  |  |
|:-|----|
| Physical asset-based company level data (ABCD)  | The analysis is currently based on data covering 52,000+ companies and 230,000+ energy-related physical assets from third-party data providers. This alleviates the necessity to rely on companies’ self-reported data that is published in a non-standardized manner and often does not account for scope 2 and 3 emissions.  |
| Forward-Looking  | PACTA provides a five-year forward-looking analysis of the production plans financed by a portfolio that are compared to climate scenarios. |
| Sector-specific approach  | The outputs of the analysis are metrics and indicators at sector and technology-level that allow for a detailed evaluation of a portfolio’s alignment, rather than one aggregated indicator at portfolio level.  |
| Allocating macroeconomic goals to microeconomic actors  | The PACTA analysis uses a market-share approach to allocate macroeconomic climate targets to companies in sectors where low-carbon technologies are available thus, all market-level trends and targets are allocated to companies based on their current market share in the sector or technology for low- and high-carbon technologies, respectively.  |

In the analysis provided for each sector, the user has the option to select from two different portfolio attribution methodologies - the Portfolio Weight Approach (PA) and the Ownership Weight Approach (OA). These methods are used to attribute the physical assets of a company to the financial instrument or portfolio.
